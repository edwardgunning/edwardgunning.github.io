# About Me

I recently completed my Ph.D. in the Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics at the [University of Limerick](https://www.ul.ie/), Ireland, where I was part of the [SFI Centre for Research Training in Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data-science.ie/).
I was advised by [Prof. Norma Bargary](https://www.ul.ie/research/dr-norma-bargary) and my thesis was titled 'Statistical Modelling of Second-Generation Functional Data with Application in Biomechanics and Human Movement Research'. It should be available on the [UL Library](https://researchrepository.ul.ie/) soon.
