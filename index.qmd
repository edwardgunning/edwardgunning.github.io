# About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. I am mentored by [Prof. Jeffrey Morris](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/jeffrey-s-morris-phd) and [Prof. Giles Hooker](https://www.gileshooker.com/). My postdoctoral research is in the development of functional data analysis methodology, driven by applications in the biomedical sciences (e.g., wearable device data, radiomic data and climate data).

I completed my Ph.D. in the Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics at the [University of Limerick](https://www.ul.ie/), Ireland, where I was part of the [SFI Centre for Research Training in Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data-science.ie/).
I was advised by [Prof. Norma Bargary](https://www.ul.ie/research/dr-norma-bargary) and my thesis was titled 'Statistical Modelling of Second-Generation Functional Data with Application in Biomechanics and Human Movement Research'.

* **Visit to JHU WIT Group**: On September 13th 2024, I visited Prof. Ciprian Crainiceanu's Wearable and Implantable Technology (WIT) Group and Johns Hopkins University. I spoke about "Functional Regression Models in Human Movement Biomechanics: Methodology and Applications". You can view the slides [here](https://github.com/ edwardgunning/JHU-Talk).


* [**ISBS 2024**](https://www.isbs2024.com/): On July $15$th $2024$, I delivered a pre-conference workshop on **Functional Data Analysis in Sports Biomechanics** at [ISBS 2024](https://www.isbs2024.com/) on in Salzburg with Prof. Drew Harrison. The materials are available at our [workshop website](https://github.com/edwardgunning/ISBS-Short-Course).
