# About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. I am mentored by [Prof. Jeffrey Morris](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/jeffrey-s-morris-phd) and [Prof. Giles Hooker](https://www.gileshooker.com/). My postdoctoral research is in the development of functional data analysis methodology, driven by applications in the biomedical sciences (e.g., wearable device data, radiomic data and climate data).

I completed my Ph.D. in the Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics at the [University of Limerick](https://www.ul.ie/), Ireland, where I was part of the [SFI Centre for Research Training in Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data-science.ie/).
I was advised by [Prof. Norma Bargary](https://www.ul.ie/research/dr-norma-bargary) and my thesis was titled 'Statistical Modelling of Second-Generation Functional Data with Application in Biomechanics and Human Movement Research'.
