    "title": "An Understanding of Principal Differential Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In functional data analysis, replicate observations of a smooth functional process and its derivatives offer a unique opportunity to flexibly estimate continuous-time ordinary differential equation models. Ramsay (1996) first proposed to estimate a linear ordinary differential equation from functional data in a technique called Principal Differential Analysis, by formulating a functional regression in which the highest-order derivative of a function is modelled as a time-varying linear combination of its lower-order derivatives. Principal Differential Analysis was introduced as a technique for data reduction and representation, using solutions of the estimated differential equation as a basis to represent the functional data. In this work, we re-formulate PDA as a generative statistical model in which functional observations arise as solutions of a deterministic ODE that is forced by a smooth random error process. This viewpoint defines a flexible class of functional models based on differential equations and leads to an improved understanding and characterisation of the sources of variability in Principal Differential Analysis. It does, however, result in parameter estimates that can be heavily biased under the standard estimation approach of PDA. Therefore, we introduce an iterative bias-reduction algorithm that can be applied to improve parameter estimates. We also examine the utility of our approach when the form of the deterministic part of the differential equation is unknown and possibly non-linear, where Principal Differential Analysis is treated as an approximate model based on time-varying linearisation. We demonstrate our approach on simulated data from linear and non-linear differential equations and on real data from human movement biomechanics. Supplementary R code for this manuscript is available at https://github.com/edwardgunning/UnderstandingOfPDAManuscript."

    "text": "We present a multivariate functional mixed effects model for kinematic data from a large number of recreational runners. The runners’ sagittal plane hip and knee angles are modelled jointly as a bivariate function with random effects functions used to account for the dependence among measurements from either side of the body. The model is fitted by first applying multivariate functional principal component analysis (mv-FPCA) and then modelling the mv-FPCA scores using scalar linear mixed effects models. Simulation and bootstrap approaches are introduced to construct simultaneous confidence bands for the fixed effects functions, and covariance functions are reconstructed to summarise the variability structure in the data and thoroughly investigate the suitability of the proposed model. In our scientific application, we observe a statistically significant effect of running speed on both the hip and knee angles. We also observe strong within-subject correlations, reflecting the highly idiosyncratic nature of running technique. Our approach is more generally applicable to modelling multiple streams of smooth kinematic or kinetic data measured repeatedly for multiple subjects in complex experimental designs."

    "title": "Statistical Modelling of Second-Generation Functional Data with Application in Biomechanics and Human Movement Research",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent years, the data being collected in human movement biomechanics have increased in size and complexity. Improvements in data acquisition and processing mean that more data can be recorded and extracted for each individual, producing datasets of increased volume that are multivariate in nature and exhibit complex dependence structures due to repeated measurements.\nFunctional data analysis is a branch of statistics that is well suited to the analysis of continuous biomechanical data, e.g., kinematics or kinetics that are recorded throughout a movement, because it treats the measured data streams as smooth, time-varying functions. Traditional functional data analysis tools have been developed for independent, univariate samples of functional data, so they are not flexible enough to fully leverage the richness of modern biomechanical datasets. There is a growing need to adapt and extend these tools to modern data structures and characteristics. To address this challenge, this thesis develops new statistical approaches for structured functional data, as motivated by a large study on running-related injuries, where kinematic data from recreational runners were captured during a treadmill run with the goal of understanding running technique and its links to injury. The motivating biomechanical dataset is rich in size and structure as it contains repeated measurements of multiple kinematic variables from a large number of individuals. Thus, it presents methodological and computational challenges and facilitates the development of novel statistical methodology that is generally applicable in a variety of fields.\nThe first challenge addressed in this thesis is the development of multivariate functional mixed effects modelling techniques, to allow the kinematic data from multiple body parts (e.g., hip and knee) to be analysed simultaneously. The mixed effects modelling framework readily incorporates covariate information and facilitates appropriate modelling of the complex dependence structure between observations from each individual (i.e., each individual has multiple repetitions of the movement/strides, measurements are made on both sides of the body). This work is divided into two sequential contributions. Firstly, a multivariate functional mixed effects model is developed for a subset of the motivating dataset, which contains average hip angle and knee angle curves for each individual on either side of the body. As the second contribution, the modelling framework is extended to handle the full collection of strides in the motivating dataset, resulting in a multivariate multilevel longitudinal functional model which uses a longitudinal functional data analysis approach to capture temporal dependence among the adjacent strides.\nThe second challenge addressed in this thesis is the estimation of continuous-time ordinary differential equations from functional data. A re-formulation of Principal Differential Analysis, a classical technique for estimating differential equations from functional data, is developed. The new formulation is based on a generative statistical model, providing a better understanding of the technique from a statistical perspective and broadening its applicability. The methodology is demonstrated on simulated data from ordinary differential equation models and on a subset of kinematic data from the motivating dataset for this thesis."

    "title": "A Multivariate Multilevel Longitudinal Functional Model for Repeatedly Observed Human Movement Data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Biomechanics and human movement research often involves measuring multiple kinematic or kinetic variables regularly throughout a movement, yielding data that present as smooth, multivariate, time-varying curves and are naturally amenable to functional data analysis. It is now increasingly common to record the same movement repeatedly for each individual, resulting in curves that are serially correlated and can be viewed as longitudinal functional data. We present a new approach for modelling multivariate multilevel longitudinal functional data, with application to kinematic data from recreational runners collected during a treadmill run. For each stride, the runners’ hip, knee and ankle angles are modelled jointly as smooth multivariate functions that depend on subject-specific covariates. Longitudinally varying multivariate functional random effects are used to capture the dependence among adjacent strides and changes in the multivariate functions over the course of the treadmill run. A basis modelling approach is adopted to fit the model – we represent each observation using a multivariate functional principal components basis and model the basis coefficients using scalar longitudinal mixed effects models. The predicted random effects are used to understand and visualise changes in the multivariate functional data over the course of the treadmill run. In our application, our method quantifies the effects of scalar covariates on the multivariate functional data, revealing a statistically significant effect of running speed at the hip, knee and ankle joints. Analysis of the predicted random effects reveals that individuals’ kinematics are generally stable but certain individuals who exhibit strong changes during the run can also be identified. A simulation study is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology under realistic data-generating scenarios."

This technical note demonstrates that PCA of waveforms is the most rudimentary form of FDA, and consequently can be rationalised within the FDA framework of statistical processes. Mathematical proofing applied demonstrations of both techniques, and an example of when fPCA may be of greater benefit to control over smoothing of functional principal components is provided using an open access motion sickness dataset. Finally, open access software is provided with this paper as means of priming the biomechanics community for using these methods as a part of future functional data explorations."

    "text": "Dimension reduction is crucial in functional data analysis (FDA). The key tool to reduce the dimension of the data is functional principal component analysis. Existing approaches for functional principal component analysis usually involve the diagonalization of the covariance operator. With the increasing size and complexity of functional datasets, estimating the covariance operator has become more challenging. Therefore, there is a growing need for efficient methodologies to estimate the eigencomponents. Using the duality of the space of observations and the space of functional features, we propose to use the inner-product between the curves to estimate the eigenelements of multivariate and multidimensional functional datasets. The relationship between the eigenelements of the covariance operator and those of the inner-product matrix is established. We explore the application of these methodologies in several FDA settings and provide general guidance on their usability."

This is a vibrant research area, at the intersection of applied statistics, or more generally, data science, and biomechanics and human movement research. This book serves as both a contextual literature review of FDA applications in biomechanics and as an introduction to FDA techniques for applied researchers. In particular, it provides a valuable resource for biomechanics researchers seeking to broaden or deepen their FDA knowledge."
